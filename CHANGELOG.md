# Changelog

Notable changes to the GameSir Cyclone 2 Linux app, newest first. This is the
curated, user-facing summary; the complete history is in git. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-controller support** — a top-bar picker to choose which connected
  controller the app drives, plus press-to-select (press a button on a pad to switch
  to it). Identical units are told apart by USB port.
- **GameSir G7 Pro** recognised, with live input over evdev. *(Its config editor is
  blocked on Linux — see [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for the full reason.)*
- Per-controller **profile abstraction**, so the whole config / lighting / backup
  stack follows the active controller instead of hard-coded Cyclone constants.
- **Startup smoke test** (`smoke_test.py`) that fails if a background thread crashes
  on launch or the QML doesn't load.

### Fixed
- **Controller switching** — the picker dropdown and press-to-select now both
  actually switch the driven controller (the dropdown taps weren't reaching the
  backend; press-to-select had crashed on a stale import after a script move).
- **Robustness / hardening** — imported backups are validated against the known
  register map before any write; the live reader survives malformed or short USB
  reports and truncated capture files. *(Local single-user threat model.)*
- **UI fit** — the top bar is responsive (the settings gear always stays reachable),
  and the Sticks / Triggers / Lights pages no longer clip at the default or minimum
  window size.

### Changed
- **Documentation restructured** into a lean [README](README.md) (overview), a
  [Manual](MANUAL.md) (how to use each feature, troubleshooting, FAQ), and
  [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) (protocol, architecture, and per-controller findings).

### Firmware Backup & Restore (advanced, optional)
- Back up the Cyclone 2's firmware and restore your own backup — wired only, brick-
  safe, and gated by an on-chip identity check. Needs the external jl-uboot-tool
  (not bundled). See [FIRMWARE.md](FIRMWARE.md).

## [0.1.0-alpha.2]

### Added
- **Config editor** — deadzones, anti-deadzones, stick trajectory, sensitivity curves
  (presets **and** a draggable custom-curve editor), trigger tuning (hair-trigger +
  response curve), vibration, poll rate, and button remap.
- **Lighting** — per-light RGB, effect presets, brightness / speed, power settings
  (audio-reactive / pick-up-to-wake / sleep), and a custom keyframe animation editor.
- **Backup / Restore** — snapshot all four profiles + lighting to JSON and write it
  back, with write-verify-retry (verified end-to-end on hardware).
- **Mouse-mode toggle** — turn KDE/KWin's sticks-drive-the-cursor behaviour off (or on
  for "couch mode"), with a desktop-agnostic EVIOCGRAB fallback.
- **One-command install** (`install.sh`) with a `.desktop` launcher, icon, and udev
  rule; plus a `packaging/PKGBUILD` for Arch.
