GameSir Cyclone 2 - "mouse mode" suppressor
===========================================
After the 2.4GHz dongle re-pairs/replugs, moving the sticks drives the desktop
cursor ("mouse mode"). We chased this all the way down (see the diagnostics in
research/gamesir_input_diag.py): it is NOT the controller's emulated interface-1
mouse/keyboard - those evdev nodes stay silent. The cursor is driven by **KDE's
KWin compositor (Plasma 6 Wayland) reading the gamepad's joystick evdev node
directly** via its built-in game-controller-to-pointer support. libinput would
normally ignore a joystick, but KWin opens it out-of-band, so a `LIBINPUT_IGNORE`
udev rule does NOT stop it. The one thing that does: take an exclusive EVIOCGRAB
on the gamepad's evdev node, so KWin can no longer read it and the cursor goes
quiet. (Confirmed by grabbing each of the controller's nodes one at a time - only
the joystick node `event2` stops the cursor.)

So this module EVIOCGRAB's the controller's JOYSTICK evdev node when suppression
is on. A background thread re-applies the grab across dongle replugs (which churn
the event-node numbers) and drains + detects dead nodes so a stale grab can't
linger.

TRADE-OFF: grabbing the gamepad node is exclusive, so while suppression is on,
evdev-based games (Steam / SDL2, which read /dev/input/event*) won't see the pad
either. The legacy joystick node (/dev/input/jsN) and our own hidraw vendor
channel are unaffected, so the app keeps reading inputs while suppressing. This
is a deliberate desktop-use toggle, not a gaming-time fix - a permanent,
gaming-safe fix would mean disabling KWin's game-controller pointer feature
system-wide (no GUI toggle exists in Plasma 6.7).

Needs read access to the controller's /dev/input/event* nodes - granted by the
udev rule (TAG+="uaccess" on SUBSYSTEM=="input" for vendor 3537).
